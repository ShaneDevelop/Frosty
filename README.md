# My Story
When I was 11 Years old, I got my first computer and I was really curious how it worked so I started building computers however, I didn't really like doing that so I started my own hosting company 2 years later named IronHost. Being 13 years old means that there is a lot of restrictions I had on this hosting company but what I did learn from my year and a half of owning it was development experience. That's when I learned my first couple coding languages. Node.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bash, and PHP these were the main ones I learned. I have been trying to start my own hosting company without any success for the past 4 years. I am 17 now and have development experience, design experience, and most importantly a lot of customer service experience. Why go with anyone else when you can go with me?
